This is a program that mashed up Target markup, Backbone, and the YouTube API to make a pretty compelling improvement to the Target website. It rebuilt the Target “product adding” logic by directly observing the target HTML elements. If user moves his mouse to the movie’s icon and waits 5 seconds, a trailer of the movie will appear and play automatically.

Techniques that were used in the application include: jQuery, Local storage, back bone template, YouTube API, etc.

Application is not limited to only Target but any website with minimum change of code.
